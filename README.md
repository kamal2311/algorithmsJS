# algothimsJS
Basic algorithms in JS based on a udemy course

This is my implementation of the algoirthms mentioned in a Udemy course
https://www.udemy.com/learning-algorithms-in-javascript-from-scratch/

Algoritms implemented are

1. FizzBuzz - Implement a function which considers numbers 1 to 20 and replaces the number with the word "Fizz" 
if the number is divisible by 3, replaces the number with the word "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 and replaces the number with
the word "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. the function should ouput any other number as is.

2. CaesarCipher - <<Description to be added>>

3. Palindrome -> Implement a function that returns true or false if the supplied string is a palindrome.

4. RansomNote ->  Implement a function that takes two parameters, a noteText and a magazineText. Returns true if all the words in the note can be built from the words in the
magazine text. returns false otherwise.
